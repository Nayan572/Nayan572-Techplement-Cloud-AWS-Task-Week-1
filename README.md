In Week 1, I set up a basic portfolio website on Amazon S3 for my internship project. Using HTML and CSS, I created and hosted the site by creating a new S3 bucket, uploading files, enabling website hosting, and setting permissions for public access.

Steps:

Step 1: Create a bucket

Step 2: Enable static website hosting

Step 3: Edit Block Public Access settings

Step 4: Add a bucket policy that makes your bucket content publicly available

Step 5: Configure an index document

Step 6: Test your website endpoint

Step 7: Clean up
